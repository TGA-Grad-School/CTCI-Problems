/* 1.3 URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20: You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)

EXAMPLE
Input: "Mr John Smith " J 13 
Output: "Mr%20J ohn%20Smith"
